                Bubble Bear is a 2D platformer made during the Global Game Jam 2025, under the theme "bubble".
                Developed in Unity, the game challenges players to guide a determined little bear trapped in bubble.
                In this game you will have to dodge danger, mastering the bubble movement, and of course, aiming for the fastest time possible.

            <h1>Raison this website exist</h1>
            <p>
                At first, players shared their best scores by posting screenshots in our Discord server.
                But comparing dozens of images wasn't ideal to know who was really the fastest.
                That's why we built this website.
                It features a live leaderboard, so players can compete directly and track their rankings in real time.
                No more scrolling through Discord. All the information are here.
            </p>
            <p>Bubble Bear isn't just a game, it's a competition.
                This website was created to bring together players from around the world to race, compete,
                and rise through the leaderboard. Whether you're a casual player or a hardcore speedrunner, every second counts.
            </p>
            <h1>
                What is speedrunning ?
            </h1>
            <p>Speedrunning is the act of completing a video game as fast as possible.</p>
            <p>
                The game is already playable on <a href="https://bryanlesc.itch.io/bubble-bear">Itch.io</a> (you can access it to via the Explore section).
                This website is still in active development to enhance the user experience.
                Start running, set records and be the fastest bear !
